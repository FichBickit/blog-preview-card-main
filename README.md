## My process

Another quick speedrun project that I did for fun, and this one was more fun as well, with a few satisfying interactives

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

This was the most satisfying thing that I did in the project:

.header {
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    font-family: "aNiceBoldFont", sans-serif;
    transition: 0.3s;
}
.header:hover {
    color: var(--yellow);
    cursor: pointer;
}

The hover states were very satisfying and I enjoyed them

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.php) - W3Schools is always a great website for tips on projects, and this one was no exception> It helped me to know how to use box-shadow to get the nice border shadow effect
